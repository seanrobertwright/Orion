## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Research phase: Next.js App Router over Pages Router (future-proof, Server Components)
- Research phase: Drizzle ORM over Prisma (14x performance, 7KB vs 300KB bundle)
- Research phase: Grammy over Telegraf for Telegram bot (better Next.js compatibility)
- Research phase: Claude API with prompt caching (90% cost reduction on repeated matching)
- Research phase: Adzuna API for job boards (legitimate, free tier available, avoid scraping legal risks)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 2 (Telegram Bot):**
- Grammy webhook setup with Next.js API routes needs validation during planning
- ngrok required for local development (webhook HTTPS requirement)

**Phase 4 (AI Resume):**
- Claude resume parsing accuracy on diverse formats needs empirical testing
- Cost optimization via prompt caching must be implemented from start

**Phase 5 (Job Boards):**
- ZipRecruiter publisher program approval may be required (fallback: Adzuna only)
